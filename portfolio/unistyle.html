        <p class="mb-4"><i>An accessible multi-touchpoint service that provides a convenient and affordable way for
            students to find affordable clothing, become more confident, and foster social interaction. Developed in
            collaboration with other UX designers.</i>
        </p>
        <p class="mb-1"><b>Timeframe:</b> 9 weeks</p>
        <p class="mb-4"><b>Tools used:</b> Figma, Voiceflow, Airtable</p>

        <p class="mb-4"><b>Situation:</b> As students begin living independently and joining the workforce, they require
          access to affordable clothing and a way to build social and professional confidence. This particularly impacts
          students with disabilities, as they face additional barriers to employment.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4"><b>Concept:</b> UniStyle is a hybrid physical and digital service designed to help students with
          their social confidence and wardrobe. It includes an online
          forum dedicated to styling and fashion advice, a clothing sales platform with both digital and in-person
          touchpoints, and an AI-powered conversational agent that serves as a styling assistant.</p>

        <h2 class="mb-4">Research and Ideation</h2>

        <p class="mb-4">After several brainstorming and feedback sessions, we decided on
          the concept of an on-campus secondhand clothing donation point with a companion website, where students could
          reserve clothing to be picked up and participant in an online forum. This concept allowed for synergy between
          physical and digital touchpoints. It also met our criteria of being
          convenient, affordable and socially engaging, which addressed the needs of our student personas.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4 text-center">Brainstorming notes for our chosen service concept, including notes on
          accessibility.</p>
        <br>

        <h2 class="mb-4">Prototyping</h2>

        <p class="mb-4">To fully visualise the scope of our service, we first developed two storyboards depicting how
          our personas would interact with the service to address their needs.
        </p>

          clothing suitable for an upcoming job interview.</p>

        <p class="mb-4 text-center">Storyboard illustrating how our persona Leila uses the service to donate unused
          clothing and improve her social confidence.</p>
        <br>

        <p class="mb-4">To test the in-person component of our service, we used Lego blocks to create a model of the
          on-campus clothing donation point and conducted a walkthrough of the service, with participants
          playing the role of potential users. Participants were briefed on our user personas and disabilities they had
          in order to test the service's accessibility. These walkthroughs provided us with valuable insights on how to
          operate the clothing exchange model. We initially used a points-based purchasing system to limit the amount of
          clothing students could receive in a week. However, after receiving feedback, we changed to a simpler
          currency-based system that would provide more of an incentive to donate clothing to the service.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4">We also developed a customer journey map in tandem with our roleplaying exercises, which
          provided a clear overview of our design and highlighted areas of improvement in the customer experience.
        </p>

          alt="Customer journey map">

        <p class="mb-4">I created several iterations of wireframes for UniStyle's companion website using Figma, making
          changes in response to user feedback. The A11y toolkit was used to annotate accessibility features, and a
          mobile-first philosophy design allowed us to scale up for desktop screens.

        <br>

        <p class="mb-4">Initially, we received user feedback that the site navigation was unintuitive. To address this,
          several sections of the website were renamed, such as the "Community" section being changed to "Forum" to
          align with external mental models. The layout was also optimised for mobile navigation.</p>

        <br>

        <h2 class="mb-4">Conversational Design</h2>

        <p class="mb-4">We used Voiceflow to create an AI-powered conversational agent for our service. It was designed
          to act as a
          "styling assistant" for students, capable of generating a personalised lookbook and recommending items based
          on user preferences. We conducted a survey to determine what factors users would value when finding clothing
          that suits their needs (such as gender presentation and colour). The survey also asked about participant
          expectations when interacting with conversational agents. Overall, respondents preferred conversational agents
          that provided instant and accurate responses that eliminated the need for human interaction.

        <br>

        <p class="mb-4">Connecting the conversational agent to an Airtable database via API calls allowed us to store
          user preferences and quickly search for suitable clothing.
