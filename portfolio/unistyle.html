      <div class="gy-4">
        <p class="mb-4">UniStyle is an accessible multi-touchpoint service that provides a convenient and affordable way
          for students to find affordable clothing, become more confident, and foster social skills. It was
          developed in collaboration with other UX designers.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-1"><b>Timeframe:</b> 9 weeks</p>
        <p class="mb-1"><b>Tools used:</b> Figma, Adobe Illustrator, Voiceflow, Airtable</p>
        <p class="mb-4"><b>Skills:</b> UI/UX Design, Service Design, Conversation Design, Accessibility Design
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4"><b>Situation:</b> As students begin living independently and joining the workforce, they require
          access to affordable clothing and a way to build social and professional confidence. This particularly impacts
          students with disabilities, who face additional barriers to employment.
        </p>

        <p class="mb-4"><b>Concept:</b> UniStyle helps students with their social confidence and wardrobe at the same
          time, and is designed with accessibility in mind. It includes an online forum dedicated to styling and fashion
          advice, a clothing sales platform with both digital and in-person touchpoints, and an AI conversational agent
          that serves as a styling assistant.</p>

        <br>

        <p class="mb-4">To test the in-person component of our service, we used building blocks to create a physical
          model of the on-campus hub and conducted a walkthrough of the service, with participants
          playing the role of potential users. Participants were briefed on our user personas and disabilities they had
          in order to test the service's accessibility. These walkthroughs provided us with valuable insights on how to
          operate the service. We initially used a points-based purchasing system to limit the amount of
          clothing students could receive in a week. However, after receiving feedback, we changed to a simpler
          currency-based system that would provide more of an incentive to donate clothing to the service.
        </p>
        <br>

        <h2 class="mb-4">Prototyping</h2>

        <p class="mb-4">The A11y toolkit was used to annotate accessibility features for our app prototypes.</p>
        <br>

        <br>

        <p class="mb-4">Initially, we received user feedback that the site navigation was unintuitive. To address this,
          several sections of the website were renamed, such as the "Community" section being changed to "Forum" to
          align with external mental models. The layout was also optimised for mobile navigation.</p>

        <br>

        <h2 class="mb-4">Conversational Design</h2>

        <p class="mb-4">We used Voiceflow to create an AI-powered conversational agent for our service. It was designed
          to act as a
          "styling assistant" for students, capable of generating a personalised lookbook and recommending items based
          on user preferences. We conducted a survey to determine what factors users would value when finding clothing
          that suits their needs (such as gender presentation and colour). The survey also asked about participant
          expectations when interacting with conversational agents. Overall, respondents preferred conversational agents
          that provided instant and accurate responses that eliminated the need for human interaction.

        </p>
        <br>

        <p class="mb-4">Connecting the conversational agent to an Airtable database via API calls allowed us to store
          user preferences and quickly search for suitable clothing.
