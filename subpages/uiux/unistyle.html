					<i>UniStyle</i> is a proposed service for the University of
					Melbourne Student Union. It includes an online forum dedicated to styling and fashion
					advice, a clothing sales platform with both digital and in-person touchpoints, and an AI-integrated
					conversational agent that serves as a styling assistant. The service is intended to provide a
					convenient and affordable way for students to improve their style, become more confident, and foster
					social interaction. It takes into account accessibility design, particularly for students
					with motor and hearing disabilities.

				<h2>ideation</h2>

				<p class="mainbody"> We crafted a problem statement that our service
					would address:
				</p>
				<p class="mainbody">
					<i>"Students encounter challenges in finding and styling affordable clothing for their careers and
						personal lifestyles due to their busy schedules. They are eager to be part of a community and
						build
						their social and professional confidence. They would like an outlet to express their creativity
						and
						help others by exchanging fashion tips/advice and decluttering clothes respectively."</i>

				</p>
				<br>
				<p class="mainbody">
					After several brainstorming sessions, we settled on the concept of a clothing donation
					service with an accompanying online forum. This concept allowed for the online and in-person
					components to
					synergise well. It also met our criteria of being convenient, low-cost and socially engaging.

				<p>Initial concept for the chosen service idea, including notes on accessibility.</p>
				<br />
				<h2>prototyping</h2>

				<p class="mainbody">To ensure equity, we initially developed a points-based system to limit the amount
					of clothing students could take in a week. However, after receiving feedback from student users, we
					transitioned to a simpler currency-based system that would provide more of an incentive to donate to
					the service.</p>
				<br>
				<p class="mainbody">I created several wireframe iterations for the companion website, refining
					them to incorporate user feedback. A mobile-first design allowed us to scale up for desktop.
					Annotations were also used for the later wireframes to show accessbility design considerations.
					I made the most changes to the layout of the navigation bar and forum section, as we received
					feedback about the navigation being unintuitive. To address this, several sections of
					the website were renamed, such as the "Community" section being changed to "Forum" to align with
					external mental models.</p>

				<img alt="Low-fidelity prototype screenshots" class="img-main" src="../../images/uiux/unistyle7.jpg" />
				<p class="mainbody">A later iteration of the prototype, created on Figma with the A11y annotation
					toolkit. The layout was further optimised for mobile navigation, and screens were added showing the
					clothing purchase and checkout process.</p>
				<br>

				<img alt="Customer journey map" class="img-main" src="../../images/uiux/unistyle5.jpg"
					onclick="zoom(this.src)" />
				<p class="mainbody">The customer journey map gives an example of a standard customer interaction with
					the service based
					on the initial user person, including both digital and physical touchpoints. The shift from a
					points-based to currency-based system for the service can be seen in this diagram.</p>
