					<i>UniStyle</i> is a proposed service designed for the University of
					Melbourne Student Union. This service includes an online forum dedicated to styling and fashion
					advice, a clothing sales platform with both digital and in-person touchpoints, and an AI-integrated
					conversational agent that serves as a styling assistant. The service is intended to provide a
					convenient and affordable way for students to improve their style and become more confident, as well
					as foster social interaction. It takes into account accessibility design, particularly for students
					with motor and hearing disabilities.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p class="mainbody"> Our group was presented with three user personas to help design our service. We
					identified their
					different needs and desires and crafted a problem statement:
				</p>
				<p class="mainbody">
					<i>"Students encounter challenges in finding and styling affordable clothing for their careers and
						personal lifestyles due to their busy schedules. They are eager to be part of a community and
						build
						their social and professional confidence. They would like an outlet to express their creativity
						and
						help others by exchanging fashion tips/advice and decluttering clothes respectively."</i>

				</p>
				<br>
				<p class="mainbody">
					During the design process, I primarily focused on initial ideation, crafting a user research survey,
					and creating several iterations of wireframes for the service's online components. I also
					contributed to the creation of customer journey storyboards and our conversational agent.
