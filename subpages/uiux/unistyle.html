					<i>UniStyle</i> is a proposed service designed for the University of
					Melbourne Student Union. This service includes an online forum dedicated to styling and fashion
					advice, a clothing sales platform with both digital and in-person touchpoints, and an AI-integrated
					conversational agent that serves as a styling assistant. The service is intended to provide a
					convenient and affordable way for students to improve their style and become more confident, as well
					as foster social interaction. It takes into account accessibility design, particularly for students
					with motor and hearing disabilities.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p class="mainbody"> Our group was presented with three user personas to help design our service. We
					identified their
					different needs and crafted a problem statement:
				</p>
				<p class="mainbody">
					<i>"Students encounter challenges in finding and styling affordable clothing for their careers and
						personal lifestyles due to their busy schedules. They are eager to be part of a community and
						build
						their social and professional confidence. They would like an outlet to express their creativity
						and
						help others by exchanging fashion tips/advice and decluttering clothes respectively."</i>

				</p>
				<br>
				<p class="mainbody">
					During the design process, I primarily focused on initial ideation, crafting a user research survey,
					and creating several iterations of wireframes for the service's online components. I also
					contributed to the creation of storyboards and our conversational agent.
				</p>
				<br>
				<h2>ideation</h2>

				<p class="mainbody">
					The group engaged in a number of brainstorming exercises to generate ideas for services that would
					match persona needs. Ultimately, we settled on the concept of a clothing donation service with an
					online forum; while some of the other ideas were promising, we wanted to narrow the scope of our
					service. This service idea also allowed for the online and in-person components to synergise well.
					It also met our criteria of being convenient, low-cost and socially engaging.

				<h2>prototyping</h2>

				<p class="mainbody">To ensure equity, we initially used a points-based system to limit the amount of
					clothing students could take in a week. However, after receiving peer and tutor feedback, we
					transitioned to a currency-based system, as it would provide more of an incentive to participate in
					the service. It would also be more simple for students to keep track of.</p>

				<p>Storyboards detailing two customer interactions with the service.</p>
				<br>
				<p>I created several iterations of website wireframes for this assignment, refining them to incorporate
					feedback during the weekly workshops. A mobile-first design allowed us to scale up for desktop.
					Annotations were also used for the later wireframes to show my accessbility design considerations.
					I made the most changes to the layout of the navigation bar and forum section, as we received
					feedback about the navigation being confusing and unintuitive. To address this, several sections of
					the website were renamed, such as the "Community" section being changed to "Forum" to align with
					external models.</p>
				<img alt="First wireframe iteration" class="img-main" src="../../images/uiux/unistyle6.jpg" />
				<p class="mainbody">The earliest iteration of the prototype where I decided on the website's basic
					functionality.</p>

				<img alt="Third wireframe iteration" class="img-main" src="../../images/uiux/unistyle7.jpg" />
				<p class="mainbody">The third iteration of the prototype, created on Figma with the A11y annotation
					toolkit. The layout was further opitmised for mobile navigation, and I added screens showing the
					clothing purchase and checkout process.</p>
				<br>
				<h2>outcomes</h2>
				<img alt="Final wireframe iteration" class="img-main" src="../../images/uiux/unistyle8.jpg"
					onclick="zoom(this.src)" />
				<p>The final high-fidelity prototypes show the culmination of the changes made across the different
					iterations of the site. This includes a hovering button that allows users to easily access the AI
					conversational agent, as well as clearer naming for different sections of the site.</p>
				<img alt="Customer journey map" class="img-main" src="../../images/uiux/unistyle9.jpg"
					onclick="zoom(this.src)" />
				<p>The customer journey map gives an example of a standard customer interaction with the service based
					on the initial user person, including both digital and physical touchpoints. The shift from a
					points-based to currency-based model for the service can be seen in this diagram.</p>
