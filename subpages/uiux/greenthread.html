					<i>Greenthread</i> is a design concept for a browser extension that tackles the issue of
					transparency in the the fashion industry. It is primarily designed for online shoppers, but also
					acts as a way for clothing brands to take accountability and identify areas of improvement.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p class="mainbody"> <i>Greenthread</i> operates by comparing the URL of the online store the user is
					browsing with its database, then notifying the user if the company is known to violate ethical
					issues that they care about, such as labour rights or using sustainable materials. It then suggests
					alternative brands that have better practices in regards to these issues. These claims are backed up
					by user-submitted evidence verified by a community moderator. Users can also search
					specific brands on <i>Greenthread</i>'s database to learn more about their practices.

				<h2>research</h2>

				<p class="mainbody">
					We identified various stakeholders with an interest in the fashion industry, creating a diagram
					showing their different wants and motivations in order to discover key issues. Several interviews
					were conducted with members of stakeholder groups, including an ethically-conscious shopper, a small
					clothing business owner and a fashion professor from RMIT. This allowed us to develop a thorough
					understanding of consumer behavior, brand practices, and develop a list of issues surrounding ethics
					and sustainability that users could choose from.
				</p>
				<br>

				<img alt="List of issues users can be notified about" class="img-main"
					src="../../images/uiux/greenthread2.jpg" />
				<p>Upon first installing the extension, users are prompted to select the social issues that they want
					to be notified about.</p>

				<br>

				<h2>prototyping</h2>

				<p class="mainbody">A low-fidelity prototype was developed for the first round of usability
					testing, where users were asked to carry out a variety of tasks that involved using different parts
					of <i>Greenthread</i> and give their thoughts on the user experience. Key issues identified included
					confusing wording on interface elements and the lack of alternative methods to contribute evidence.
					This participant feedback was used in the development of a second higher-fidelity prototype.
				</p>
				<br>

				<ul style="max-width: 50%; margin: auto;">
					<li>83% of users said that they would use <i>Greenthread</i> or a similar product.</li>
					<li>All but one user felt the product would have an impact on their shopping behavior.</li>
				</ul>
				<br>

				<img alt="Low-fidelity prototype" class="img-main" src="../../images/uiux/greenthread3.jpg" />
				<p>Initial low-fidelity prototype.</p>

				<br>

				<img alt="High-fidelity prototype" class="img-main" src="../../images/uiux/greenthread4.jpg" />
				<p>Higher-fidelity prototype.</p>
				<br>

				<p class="mainbody">We plan to make further improvements to the interface, such as increasing the
					font size to improve readability and streamlining the information panels. In order to make
					<i>Greenthread</i> a tool that encourages consumers to become more aware of brand practices, we also
					aim to add search filters, product categories and price range indicators to our company database.
					This allows shoppers to find alternative ethical fashion brands that fit their needs.
