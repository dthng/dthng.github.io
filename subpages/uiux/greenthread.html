					<i>Greenthread</i> is a design concept for a browser extension that tackles the issue of
					transparency in the the fashion industry. It is primarily designed for online shoppers, but also
					acts as a way for clothing brands to take accountability and identify areas of improvement.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p class="mainbody"> <i>Greenthread</i> operates by comparing the URL of the online store the user is
					browsing with its database, then notifying the user if the company is known to violate ethical
					issues that they care about, such as labour rights or using sustainable materials. It then suggests
					alternative brands that have better practices in regards to these issues. These claims are backed up
					by user-submitted evidence verified by a community moderator. Users can also search
					specific brands on <i>Greenthread</i>'s database to learn more about their practices.

				<h2>research</h2>

				<p class="mainbody">
					We identified various stakeholders with an interest in the fashion industry, creating a diagram
					showing their different wants and motivations in order to discover key issues. Several interviews
					were conducted with members of stakeholder groups, including an ethically-conscious shopper, a small
					clothing business owner and a fashion professor from RMIT. This allowed us to develop a thorough
					understanding of consumer behavior, brand practices, and develop a list of issues surrounding ethics
					and sustainability that users could choose from.
				</p>
				<br>

				<h2>prototyping</h2>

				<p class="mainbody">An initial low-fidelity prototype was developed for the first round of usability
					testing, which test users responded positively to. Key issues identified included confusing
					terminology and restrictions on what qualified as eligible evidence for a submission. This
					participant feedback was used in the development of the final prototype.
